Getting Started
---------------

1. Android Studio (Jellyfish or above)
2. JDK 21 with `JAVA_HOME` environment variable set. If you don't have JDK 21 installed or `JAVA_HOME` is not set, consider using a tool like `sdkman` to simplify the process. Refer to the sdkman documentation for installation instructions: [sdkman installation](https://sdkman.io/install)
